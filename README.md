# Datadog Agent builders

This repo contains the Dockerfiles of the images used to build the rpm and deb
packages for the Datadog [Agent][agent].

## How to use

You can follow [these instructions][agent-omnibus] to build a package locally:
please notice rpm packages are signed, so you won't be able to exactly reproduce
the same artifact that's distributed through the official Yum repository.

If you're a Datadog employee building new images used in the Datadog Agent
pipeline, you will have to replace the `DATADOG_AGENT_BUILDIMAGES` variable
in the [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
of the [datadog-agent repository][agent] to use the newly created images.
